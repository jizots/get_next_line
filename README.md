# Project README
## Overview
This project involves the development of the get_next_line function in C, which efficiently reads lines from a file descriptor.  
The core objective is to enhance file reading capabilities by reading one line at a time, making it a highly useful addition to any developer's toolkit.  
The function also offers an excellent opportunity to understand and implement static variables in C.  
  
## Features
Reads lines from a file descriptor efficiently.  
Handles different file descriptors simultaneously (as part of the bonus section).  
Works effectively both with files and standard input.  
Includes error handling for unexpected terminations.  
  
## Usage
To use ft_gnl, include it in your C project:  

Compile the project with the function.  
Call ft_gnl with a valid file descriptor to read lines one by one.
